With response time\n        as our primary success metric, we're prioritizing hiring in November.</p>\n        <p>We also added more specialized roles in\n        the team, for example, having one liaison between each of the Product and Happiness teams in order to\n        streamline some meetings (and cancel others!), as well as one team member focusing on self-help resources.\n        We're now hiring to form a Twitter-specific team, too.</p>\n        <p>We also separated out business support last month. The new business support and customer success teams\n        will focus on the specific needs of customers using Buffer as part of their business strategy. Key metrics\n        for this area will include increased customer engagement, reduced churn, NPS score and customer satisfaction\n        score to mention a few.

We've successfully split this large team into smaller,\n        4-6 person teams that are able to work autonomously and move fast.</p>\n        <p>We still have some roles where a single person needs to be working across several teams, and\n        a key hiring goal is for us to reach a point where everyone working on products at Buffer is\n        focused on a single area. This will help us to move much faster in the future. All of these\n        changes and our increased pace are starting to be noticed. Here's a great note we received\n        from a customer recently:</p>\n        <p><em>\"I'm very surprised! In the last 5 days you add two great features to Buffer. First the\n        ability to post videos simultaneously to various accounts and second we now can upload\n        thumbnail images to the links we share thru Buffer in Facebook and LinkedIn. I just want to\n        say thanks cause I feel heard. And I hope you keep hearing us.\"</em></p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>We launched <a href=\"https://buffer.com/video\">Buffer for Video</a> and it got a\n          <a href=\"http://www.producthunt.com/tech/buffer-for-video\">great reception from the community</a>.</li>\n          <li>We've validated product/market fit for our <a href=\"https://buffer.com/optimal-scheduling?utm_campaign=schedule_tab\">optimal scheduling tool</a>.</li>\n          <li>A new version of <a href=\"https://buffer.com/pablo\">Pablo</a> will launch very soon.</li>\n        </ul>",

Some of the changes\n        that have resulted include:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>A bias towards small teams with clear roles. Small teams can feel more ownership and move fast.</li>\n          <li>Embracing the idea of higher level work as a separate task carried out by people, rather than spread\n          across everyone.</li>\n          <li>Starting up mentorship again, through regular 1:1s. 1:1s are a great way to maintain help and\n          guidance, without managers.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>To tie all this together, we have started to develop our own internal tool to help us organize ourselves\n        and create visibility to the roles people have.

We've realized that hierarchy\n        and structure are very different things, and structure is key to working efficiently. Some of the changes\n        that have resulted include:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>A bias towards small teams with clear roles. Small teams can feel more ownership and move fast.</li>\n          <li>Embracing the idea of higher level work as a separate task carried out by people, rather than spread\n          across everyone.</li>\n          <li>Starting up mentorship again, through regular 1:1s. 1:1s are a great way to maintain help and\n          guidance, without managers.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>To tie all this together, we have started to develop our own internal tool to help us organize ourselves\n        and create visibility to the roles people have.
